If you go to your actual blog on the web (https://<your github username>.github.io/student), you will notice that the changes are not reflected there. To ensure that the actual website updates, you will need to commit your changes to your Github repository. \n",

    "1. Click on the button that says \"Source Control\" in VS Code's left sidebar\n",

    "### Overview\n",

    "AWS Route 53 is a DNS service that provides routing to web applications. When you enter a URL in your web browser, the request is sent to a DNS resolver. The resolver finds a Route 53 server that can translate the URL into its corresponding IP address. The Route 53 server sends the information back to the resolver, who then sends it to the browser. The browser is able to access the webpage through the IP address it received. \n",

Finally, in the \"Value\" section, enter your Github URL in the form of: `<username>.github.io`. **Be sure to omit the link to your repository** (use `<username>.github.io` instead of `<username>.github.io/student`). \n",

    "1. Create a Github pages repository and click on \"Settings\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the sidebar, click on \"Pages\". Under \"Build and deployment\", ensure that the Github Pages is being built from the main branch. If you forked nighthawkcoders/student, you might need to specify that before you can move on to Step 3.\n",

So if you encounter this error, you may have to be patient.)\n",
