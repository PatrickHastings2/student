    "> A brief overview of Bash, on your way to becoming a Linux expert.  When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started.  This kernel provides a shell that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands.  Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process.  To activate a shell directly, users will run a \"terminal\" through the Desktop. VS Code provides ability to activate \"terminal\" while in the IDE."

      "- `JavaScript` documents are focused on frontend development and for entry class into the Del Norte Computer Science pathway.  JavaScript documents and materials are a prerequisites to Python and Java classes.\n",
      "- `Python` documents are focused on backend development and requirements for the AP Computer Science Principles exam.\n",
      "- `Java` documents are focused on backend development and requirements for the AP Computer Sciene A exam.\n",
      "- `Data Structures` materials embedded into JavaScript, Python, or Java documents are focused on college course articulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Resources and Instruction\n",
      "The materials, such as this README, as well as `Tools`, `DevOps`, and `Collaboration` resources are integral part of this course and Computer Science in general.  Everything in our environment is part of our learning of Computer Science. \n",
      "- `Visual Studio Code` is key the code-build-debug cycle editor used in this course, [VSCode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  This is an example of a resource, but inside of it it has features for collaboration.\n",
      "- `Tech Talks`, aka lectures, are intended to be interactive and utilize `Jupyter Notebooks` and Websites.  This is an example of blending instruction and tools together, which in turn provide additional resources for learning.  For instance, deep knowledge on  GitHub Pages and Notebooks are valuable in understanding principles behind Full Stack Development and Data Science. \n",
      "\n",
      "## GitHub Pages\n",
      "All `GitHub Pages` websites are managed on GitHub infrastructure. GitHub uses `Jekyll` to tranform your content into static websites and blogs. Each time we change files in GitHub it initiates a GitHub Action that rebuilds and publishes the site with Jekyll.  \n",
      "- GitHub Pages is powered by: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).\n",
      "- Publised teacher website: [nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher/)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preparing a Preview Site \n",
      "In all development, it is recommended to test your code before deployment.  The GitHub Pages development process is optimized by testing your development on your local machine, prior to files on GitHub\n",
      "\n",
      "Development Cycle. For GitHub pages, the tooling described below will create a development cycle  `make-code-save-preview`.  In the development cycle, it is a requirement to preview work locally, prior to doing a VSCode `commit` to git.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deployment Cycle.  In the deplopyment cycle, `sync-github-action-review`, it is a requirement to complete the development cycle prior to doing a VSCode `sync`.  The sync triggers github repository update.  The action starts the jekyll build to publish the website.  Any step can have errors and will require you to do a review.\n",
